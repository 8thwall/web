## Uploading to Console

To link the image targets to your app key, you will need to upload each image to your app in console at console.8thwall.com.

Image target metadata allows us to generalize behaviors, linking specific data to the image targets themselves. Add the correct metadata to each image target on the console to make it available to your app.
