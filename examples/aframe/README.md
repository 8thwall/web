# 8th Wall Web Examples - AFrame

Example 8th Wall Web projects using AFrame:

* [Tap to place](https://github.com/8thwall/web/examples/aframe/placeground) - This interactive example allows the user to grow trees on the ground by tapping. This showcases raycasting, instantiating objects, importing 3D models and the animation system.

* [Toss an object](https://github.com/8thwall/web/examples/aframe/shoot-tomato) - This interactive example lets the user tap the screen to toss tomatoes. When they hit the ground, they splat and make a sound. This introduces physics, collision events and playing sounds.

* [Portal](https://github.com/8thwall/web/examples/aframe/portal) - This example shows off the popular portal illusion in web AR using three.js materials and the camera position as an event trigger.

After following the steps above, you should have fully functional versions of:
