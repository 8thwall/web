# 8th Wall Web Examples - AFrame

Example 8th Wall Web projects using AFrame:

* [Tap to place](https://github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/examples/aframe/placeground) - This interactive example allows the user to grow trees on the ground by tapping. This showcases raycasting, instantiating objects, importing 3D models and the animation system.

* [Toss an object](https://github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/examples/aframe/tossobject) - This interactive example lets the user tap the screen to toss tomatoes. When they hit the ground, they splat and make a sound. This introduces physics, collision events and playing sounds.

* [Portal](https://github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/examples/aframe/portal) - This example shows off the popular portal illusion in web AR using three.js materials and the camera position as an event trigger.

* [Manipulate](https://github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/examples/aframe/manipulate) - This example shows how to use touch gestures to manipulate a 3D object.

* [Capture a photo](https://github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/examples/aframe/capturephoto) - This example allows the user to capture photo evidence of a UFO abduction.

After following the steps above, you should have fully functional versions of:
